## FAQ - Frequently Asked Questions

Below is a list of the most common questions about BroccoliSwap:

<details>

  <summary>**How much are the transaction fees on BroccoliSwap?**</summary>

  On BroccoliSwap, each transaction incurs a minimal fee of 0.25%, with 0.125% going towards DEGENX Liquidity Backing and Staking. Additionally, fees apply for using liquidity providers/bridges, but BroccoliSwap ensures you get the best rate for your trade.

</details>

<details>

  <summary>**When using BroccoliSwap, where are gas fees paid?**</summary>

  - Gas fees are due on the chain where the assets originate, paid in the native currency (e.g., AVAX for Avalanche C-Chain, ETH for Ethereum).
  
  - For the destination chain, BroccoliSwap handles the gas fees, meaning you won't need native tokens there for gas.

  <summary>**What steps should I take if my transaction doesn't go through?**</summary>

  1. Check you have sufficient native tokens for gas on the starting chain.
  2. - Retry the transaction for trades within the same chain.
