# LinkBridge

## Introduction

DGNX is now available on both the Avalanche and Ethereum networks. LinkBridge acts as a bridge, enabling the seamless transfer of DGNX between these two networks. But LinkBridge is not just a typical token bridge; it's designed to also facilitate the transfer of DAO governance decisions, including aspects related to tokenomics, across different blockchain platforms. This is made possible with the backing of Celers' cBridge. This underlying technology guarantees a secure and efficient bridging experience by leveraging a proven protocol and infrastructure. This integration ensures a fluid interaction with all supported networks within our ecosystem.

LinkBridge is fully integrated with BroccoliSwap, the multi-chain swap aggregator created by DEGENX, making it easy for holders to swiftly transfer their DGNX between the supported networks.
