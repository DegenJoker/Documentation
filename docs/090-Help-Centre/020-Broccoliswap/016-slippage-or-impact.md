title: Price Impact vs. Price Slippage
---

While both terms are related to price changes in cryptocurrency trading, they are distinct:

**Price Impact** is the direct effect your trade has on the token's price, calculated as the difference between the market price and the adjusted price due to your trade's influence on the pool's liquidity.

**Price Slippage** encompasses broader market movements' impact on the token price from the time a swap is initiated to when it's finalised.

:::note
It's crucial to recognise the differences between these terms as they play significant roles in the outcomes of your trading activities.
