title: What is a transaction hash?
---

A transaction hash, also known as a transaction ID, is a unique string of characters that identifies each transaction on the blockchain.


To track or review a transaction, you can use blockchain explorers. For accuracy and clarity, it's advisable to copy and paste the transaction hash directly from your wallet or a blockchain explorer. Relying on screenshots to share transaction hashes can lead to errors; images may blur or pixelate the characters, complicating the work of support agents and potentially delaying issue resolution.
